# Supabase SQL Setup - Step by Step

## If you got "requested path is invalid" error:

This might mean:
1. The SQL Editor path is different
2. You need to navigate differently
3. The project might need a moment to fully initialize

## Alternative Steps:

### Method 1: Direct SQL Editor Access

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hwzcxcyfizrvgkaghmjx
2. In the left sidebar, look for **"SQL Editor"** or **"SQL"**
3. Click it
4. You should see a query editor

### Method 2: Use Table Editor (Easier!)

Instead of SQL, we can create tables manually:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"Table Editor"** in left sidebar
3. Click **"New table"**
4. We'll create each table one by one

### Method 3: Check Project Status

1. Make sure your Supabase project shows as **"Active"** (not "Setting up")
2. If it's still setting up, wait 2-3 more minutes
3. Refresh the page

## Quick Test:

Try accessing your project directly:
- https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hwzcxcyfizrvgkaghmjx/sql/new

If that doesn't work, let's try the Table Editor method instead!

## What would you like to try?

1. **Table Editor** (easiest - visual interface)
2. **Wait and retry SQL Editor** (if project is still initializing)
3. **Try connection pooler** (different connection method)

Let me know which you prefer!
