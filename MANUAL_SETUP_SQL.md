# Manual Database Setup via Supabase SQL Editor

Since the connection is having issues, let's set up the database tables manually using Supabase's SQL Editor. This is actually easier!

## Steps:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**: https://hwzcxcyfizrvgkaghmjx.supabase.co

2. **Click "SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

3. **Click "New query"**

4. **Copy and paste this SQL** (I'll provide it below)

5. **Click "Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

6. **Verify tables were created** - You should see success messages

## SQL to Run:

I'll create a migration SQL file that you can copy and paste into Supabase SQL Editor. This will create all the tables we need.

After running the SQL, we can:
- Skip the Prisma migration (tables already exist)
- Just generate the Prisma client
- Add your admin account

Let me create the SQL file for you!
